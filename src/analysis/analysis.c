 * @brief Implementation of static code analysis functions.
 *
 * This file provides the core implementation of the static analysis subsystem.
 * It walks the abstract syntax tree (AST), constructs and propagates scope
 * information, assigns node and scope identifiers, builds symbol bindings, and
 * performs semantic checks. These steps ensure that the code is structurally
 * and semantically correct before further compilation stages such as
 * optimization and code generation.
