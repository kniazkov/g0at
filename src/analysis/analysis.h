 * @brief Declarations for static code analysis functions.
 *
 * This header defines the public interface for the static analysis subsystem.
 * Static analysis operates on the abstract syntax tree (AST) to:
 * - Assign unique identifiers to nodes within scopes
 * - Link nodes to their lexical scopes
 * - Populate symbol tables with bindings
 * - Perform semantic checks such as undeclared identifiers, duplicate definitions,
 *   unreachable code, and type consistency
 *
 * The functions declared here form the foundation for the compilerâ€™s semantic phase.

 * - Assigning unique identifiers to scopes and nodes
 * - Building scope chains and symbol bindings
 * - Resolving identifiers and references
 * - Performing semantic checks (e.g., undeclared identifiers, duplicate declarations,

 * @return Pointer to a linked list of compilation errors discovered during analysis, or NULL
