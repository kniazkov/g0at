 * @brief Defines structures and function prototypes for the parser.
 *
 * This file contains the definition of structures and function prototypes for the parser,
 * which transforms a stream of tokens generated by the scanner into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
 * The parser validates the syntactic correctness of the input and prepares data
 * for further analysis, transformation, or bytecode generation.
