 * It supports both standard I/O and file I/O in a way that ensures memory safety
 * and error handling. The functions in this file are designed to work with
 * UTF-8 encoded text files and wide-character strings.

 * such as GPIO libraries or configurations. On platforms with GPIO support, it will initialize 
 * the necessary libraries. This function should be called at the beginning of the application
 * to ensure proper initialization of the I/O system.

 * @brief Reads a UTF-8 encoded file and returns the decoded string.

 * structure, which contains the decoded string, its length, and a flag indicating whether the 
 * calling method is responsible for freeing the allocated memory.
 * 
 * If the file cannot be opened, read, or decoded, the returned structure will contain a `NULL` 
 * string and a length of `0`. If the file contains valid UTF-8 data, the returned structure will 
 * contain the decoded string and its length.
 * 
 * @param filename The name of the file to read (UTF-8 encoded).
 * @return A `string_value_t` structure containing the decoded wide-character string, its length, 
 *  and a flag indicating whether the memory should be freed by the caller. If the function fails
 *  to read or decode the file, the structure will contain a `NULL` string.
 * 
 * @note This function does not check the validity of the UTF-8 content in detail â€” if the content
 *  is invalid, it will return a `NULL` string, and the `should_free` flag will be `false`.

 * the functionality of `format_string` for formatting and UTF-8 encoding with file output.
 * 
 * The function supports the following format specifiers:
 * - **`%c`**: Inserts a single wide character (`wchar_t`).
 * - **`%s`**: Inserts a wide-character string (`wchar_t*`).
 * - **`%d`, `%i`**: Inserts a signed integer (`int`).
 * - **`%u`**: Inserts an unsigned integer (`unsigned int`).
 * - **`%zu`**: Inserts an unsigned size (`size_t`).
 * - **`%ld`, `%li`**: Inserts a 64-bit signed integer (`int64_t`).
 * - **`%f`**: Inserts a double, formatted according to `double_to_string`.
 * - **`%%`**: Inserts a literal `%`.
 * 
 * @param file The file stream where the formatted string should be printed
 *  (e.g., `stdout` or `stderr`).
 * @param format The wide-character format string containing placeholders for the arguments.
 * @param ... The variable arguments to substitute into the format string.
